## Read

I was asked to read [Beyond Being There](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l-CKW7vFTfFZ9nTiW5YW0xiD55KzOzWj/view?usp=sharing) from beginning up to Examples on p. 121.

The author argues that we shouldn't aim for simply imitating the real face-to-face communication when designing a face-to-face communication tool because the people at a distance will never stop being at a disadvantage until we use the same mechanisms to interact with each other when we are physically close as when we are physically distant.

He suggests in order to make real progress on the telecommunication problem, we must develop tools that people prefer to use even when they have the option of interacting as they have heretofore in physical proximity - tools that go beyond being there.

To design such tools, he suggests asking the question: what's wrong with (physically proximate) reality? That is, when we view physically proximate reality as simply a medium, we can ask what requirements it meets well, and also what ones it meets poorly, inefficiently, or not at all. We can then explore new mechanisms to meet those needs, mechanisms which leverage the strengths of the new medium.

After reading this, I think it depends on the goal of the tool we are trying to create. I would agree to the author if the purpose of the tool is solely for communication. But if the tool's goal is to make people have a sense of being together in the same space, I don't think it is necessary to go beyond this. For example, when you are far away from your family at home and you want to see them, the best face-to-face communication tool can be something like a VR headset that allows you meet with your family at home making you believe that you are with them in the same physical space. In this case, I don't think there's a reason for the tool to provide more than the sense of being there.


## Create

### Description

I was asked to design a real-time connected experience for two people using p5LiveMedia and p5.js. I created a video communication tool called "8-bit Room" which simply makes each participant's face through the webcam pixelated.

There are many video communication tools out there (e.g. Zoom) that allow us to see each other's face through the webcam and chat. And usually these tools provide participants an option to turn their webcam on or off. And even though these tools are meant to be used for video communication, there are some occasions I choose to turn off my webcam because I feel reluctant to show my face when for example, I just got out of the bed and my hair looks funny, or I forgot to shave, or I'm eating some food, or I just want to have my privacy. And especially, if I use a video communication tool to chat with strangers, I would be more hesitant to show my face for privacy reason. But turning off the webcam completely makes it no more a video communication and it won't be as engaging.

So I imagined "What if there's a video communication tool that can protect our privacy, wouldn't it help more people feel comfortable showing their faces through the webcam?".

So I created a prototype of a video communication tool called "8-bit Room" which simply makes each participant's face through the webcam pixelated. Since your face is shown to others as an old 8-bit game character style, you don't need to worry about how you look to other participants and you can keep your privacy. And although participants see each other's pixelated faces, they can still see rough facial expressions and hand gestures which allows them to still video communicate.

### Questions

* Who is this for? 
    friends and strangers
* What is shared between participants?
    Pixelated face of each participant.
* Where is this interaction taking place? 
    They see each other and chat in the web page.
* Why?  What is the nature of this interaction? 
    It makes participants feel more comfortable to show their faces through the webcam because it can protect their privacy.
